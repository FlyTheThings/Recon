namespace DroneInterface {
	//The DroneManager is a singleton class; it provides the main drone interface to other software components
	//Drones are identified by their serial numbers. A vector of serial numbers for currently connected drones
	//can be retrieved by the drone manager and individual drones can be accessed by serial number. Once a drone
	//object is created for a drone with a specific serial, the drone object should remain in existence for the
	//lifetime of the program, even if the connection to it is lost. If the connection is re-established, the
	//new connection should be attached to the existing drone object. This way, a valid pointer to a drone object
	//provided by the drone manager will never be invalidated in the future.

	//DroneManager is the analagous engine to ShadowDetectionEngine and ShadowPropagationEngine. 
	//Need to store the pointers to the drone object, similar to the Callbacks to the InstantaneousShadowMaps
	
	// 7.5.2021: Copied over Parthiv's code
	// In Parthiv's original code, he basically copies over the tcp_server example from the tacopie project
	// In this example, a tcp_server is started. This server listens for any tcp connection requests, creates a tcp_client
	// The handle for this unique client is stored in m_droneRealVector
	// This server and the clients are active until the function exits. Therefore in the original code, a mutex lock
	// is created, and it is released via SIGINT signal. This created a problem because the related variable and signal_handler 
	// had to be created as GLOBAL variables: SUPER BAD!!!!! Especially when integrating with Recon
	// The solution to this is to create a while loop that terminates when m_abort is set to true

	// Following the Start, Stop, Constructor, deconstructor formats from ShadowDetection and ShadowPropagation
	// Start(): set m_running flag to true
	// Stop():  set m_running flag to false
	// ModuleMain(): This is called in the Constructor onto a separate thread. Starts tcp_server. Enters while loop and exits when m_abort set to true
	// Constructor: starts ModuleMain, and consequently the tcp_server, on the thread m_DroneManagerThread
	// Deconstructor: sets m_abort to true, waits for ModuleMain to close and cleans up the thread
