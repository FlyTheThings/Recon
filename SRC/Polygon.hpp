//Class for representing a simple polygon. A simple polygon is defined by a single piecewise-linear, closed curve in the plane defining it's boundary.
//A simple polygon has no holes and it's boundary may only touch itself at isolated points. It does not overlap itself, the boundary does not cross itself,
//and stretches of boundary with positive length are not used more than once. A simple polygon may be convex or non-convex. If created with a sequence of
//points that do not define a simple polygon (e.g. edge segments intersect) the outline of the provided non-simple polygon will be used to define the object.
//This will, in many instances at least, yield reasonable and expected behavior since often self-intersections in polygons are accidents rather than deliberate.
//We don't attempt to support set operations on simple polygons (like union, intersection, and difference) because the results of these operations on simple
//poygons are not, in general, simple polygons themselves.

//invalid state. For simplicity we keep the vertices private and only allow them to be accessed through a const reference. The vertices can be set using
