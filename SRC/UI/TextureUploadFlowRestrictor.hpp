//Warning: Do not call WaitUntilUploadIsAllowed() from the main thread or you may deadlock.
//Also, ensure that any thread that does call WaitUntilUploadIsAllowed() isn't holding any locks that
//might hold up the main thread or you may also deadlock. Note: We might want to re-architect this to
//have WaitUntilUploadIsAllowed() timeout after some small amount of time if it isn't reset. This would
//be a failsafe against deadlocks from unexpected thread interactions like those just mentioned. For now
//though, lets keep it the way it is so we can track down those bugs and fix them rather than hide them.
